# Email-based Two-Factor Authentication

The backend now enforces email-based two-factor authentication (2FA) for every user account. After a user enters valid credentials, a short-lived verification code is sent to the account's email address. The login flow completes only after the code is confirmed.

## How it works

1. **Password check** – `POST /api/auth/login` validates the email/password pair. If the account has 2FA enabled, the API responds with `requiresTwoFactor: true` and a `twoFactorToken` representing the pending login session. A numeric code is sent to the user via email.
2. **Code verification** – `POST /api/auth/verify-2fa` consumes the `twoFactorToken` plus the code from the email. A JWT is issued only after successful verification.
3. **Optional resend** – `POST /api/auth/resend-2fa` resends a new code (honouring cooldown/attempt limits) for the same pending login session.

The pending login session and verification code expire 10 minutes after they are issued. Five incorrect codes in a row invalidate the session.

## Configuring email delivery

The service uses the `Email` section in `appsettings*.json`:

```json
"Email": {
  "FromAddress": "aipharmproject@gmail.com",
  "FromName": "AIPharm",
  "SmtpHost": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "SmtpPort": 587,
  "EnableSsl": true,
  "Username": "aipharmproject@gmail.com",
  "Password": "vdzotamtdvlirmpt",
  "PickupDirectory": "App_Data/Emails",
  "UsePickupDirectory": false,
  "CheckCertificateRevocation": false
}
```

- **Sender account:** The backend uses the dedicated Gmail mailbox `aipharmproject@gmail.com`. Use the Gmail app password `vdzotamtdvlirmpt` (copy it without spaces) for SMTP authentication and update the configuration if you ever rotate the secret or move to another provider.
- **Per-user delivery:** Leave `OverrideToAddress` unset so verification codes are sent to each account's email address.
- **Local pickup folder (optional):** Set `UsePickupDirectory` to `true` if you want `.eml` files written to `AIPharm.Backend/AIPharm.Web/App_Data/Emails` instead of dispatching through Gmail. This is helpful when testing with fictional mailboxes because the messages never leave your machine.
- **SMTP host:** Gmail uses `smtp.gmail.com` on port `587` with STARTTLS (`EnableSsl: true`). Adjust the settings if you switch providers.
- **Secrets:** For production scenarios store credentials securely (environment variables, user-secrets, Key Vault, etc.).

### Gmail SMTP checklist

If no email arrives in your inbox:

- **Confirm 2-Step Verification and the app password** – Visit your [Google Account security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security), enable 2-Step Verification, and create an App Password for "Mail". Paste the 16-character password (without spaces) into `appsettings*.json`.
- **Allow IMAP/SMTP access** – In Gmail's *Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP*, keep IMAP enabled. Gmail rejects SMTP connections that rely on app passwords when IMAP access is disabled.
- **Verify credentials** – The `Username` and `Password` in `appsettings*.json` must match the Gmail mailbox exactly. Rebuild the backend container after updating these secrets.
- **Keep pickup disabled** – Set `UsePickupDirectory` to `false` when you expect real emails. When enabled, messages are saved as `.eml` files under `AIPharm.Backend/AIPharm.Web/App_Data/Emails` and no outbound SMTP attempt is made.
- **Certificate revocation checks** – `CheckCertificateRevocation` is disabled by default to avoid TLS handshake failures in restricted environments where CRL/OCSP endpoints are unreachable. Enable it only when the hosting environment allows outbound HTTPS to Google's revocation services.
- **Check backend logs** – `docker-compose logs backend` should contain `Email for <recipient> sent via SMTP server smtp.gmail.com:587`. Any `Failed to send email` entries include the raw SMTP error for troubleshooting.

## Example sequence (Gmail delivery)

```bash
# 1) Login with credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"aipharmproject@gmail.com","password":"Admin123!"}'

# Response excerpt
# {
#   "requiresTwoFactor": true,
#   "twoFactorToken": "...",
#   "codeExpiresAt": "2024-09-18T11:22:33.123Z"
# }

# 2) Retrieve the code from your inbox (the sender is aipharmproject@gmail.com). If you enabled the pickup directory, the `.eml` file is stored under AIPharm.Backend/AIPharm.Web/App_Data/Emails instead of being sent.

# 3) Submit the code + token to finish authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/verify-2fa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "email":"aipharmproject@gmail.com",
  "twoFactorToken":"<token-from-step-1>",
  "code":"123456"
}'
```

If the code expires or the email is lost, call `POST /api/auth/resend-2fa` with the same email and `twoFactorToken`. Respect the cooldown (60 seconds by default) between resends.
